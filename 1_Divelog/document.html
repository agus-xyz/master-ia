        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">Introduction 📖</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">A dive log is a record of the diving history of an underwater diver. Recreational divers are generally advised to keep a logbook as a record, while professional divers may be legally obliged to maintain a logbook which is up to date and complete.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">
        Still nowadays many divers choose to keep their logs in physical books since available digital solutions do not fulfil their needs. The proposed web application showcases a web-based diving log including the following features:

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-700">How to Use 🛠️</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            To get started, open the application in a web browser and follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Click on <span class="font-medium">"Add New Log"</span> to create a new dive log entry.</li>
            <li>Fill out the details for each field, including dive location, date, depth, and other relevant information. 📍</li>
            <li>To edit or delete a log, use the respective icons on each entry. 📝❌</li>
            <li>All data is stored locally in your browser, so you can return to your logs any time from the same device. 📱</li>

        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            This application was built using ChatGPT in about 16 iterations. Check out all stages on <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/agus-xyz/master-ia/tree/master/1_Divelog"> GitHub</a>
        </p>
        
        <p><span class="font-medium">The basics (iterations 1-3):</span> Our first goal was to get a very basic but functional dive log. I took a couple of iterations to get there. Our initial prompt was:</p>
        <br/>
        <div class="bg-gray-800 text-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
            <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap">
            <p class="text-sm">Create a scuba diving log  web application. The application MUST:

1. Allow the user to create, edit and delete diving logs.
2. Display the stored logs in a list.
3. Create a detail view for each log that opens up in a modal, that allows to edit and delete.
4. If there are no diving logs yet, it should have an appealing placeholder that inspires to add one. 
5. Use an appealing, clean, minimalistic style with Tailwind CSS
6. Include all needed HTML, CSS and JavasCript code in a single file.
7. Load Tailwind CSS from a CDN
8. Operate completely in the client-side, and use LocalStore to store the data
9. Give clear instructions on how to open and use the application on a double-clic.

Generate the complete code, and make sure that it can be executed just by opening the resulting HTML file. 
Ask me anything you need.

        <br/>       
        <p><span class="font-medium">Feature enrichment (iterations 4-10):</span> After getting to a basic functional state, we asked the IA for suggestions on how to improve the application and we went applying some of the suggestions sequentially.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><span class="font-medium">Final tweaks and fixes (iterations 10-16):</span> Final bugfixing, details and styling tweaks where we required some manual code inspection and manual amends at some points. Also here, we started requesting for partial code changes rather than complete code generation.</p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li><span class="font-medium">Unattentive IA:</span> When new features were requested to be added, previous available features would often result broken and unavailable. 🐞</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Untested code:</span> A couple of times we had execution problems and had to provide console error logs to the IA to get them fixed. 🛠️</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Manual intervention:</span> At some point, specifically with fine details, the IA would miss the capability to fix the problems that was requested to fix, requiring from human manual intervention or at least manual inspection to better understand the problems source and therefore defining more specific and narrowed requests. 🔍</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Progressively Lazy IA:</span> Specially on the last stages of the development, the IA would stop providing the complete application code, even when requested so. Therefore, at some point we stoped requesting the full code but only for partial changes. 🤖</li>
            <li><span class="font-medium">Unstable and buggy ChatGPT platform:</span> Had to deal sometimes with "Oooops, there was a problem with your request" situations by ChatGPT platform which some have not been even resolved yet. ⚠️</li>
